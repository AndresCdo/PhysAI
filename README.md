# PhysAI
 
PhysAI is an open-source project aimed at developing an AI system that generates, tests, and validates physical equations, with a particular focus on linking quantum mechanics and general relativity. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and integrating them with existing research, PhysAI aims to create accurate and reliable equations that can explain physical phenomena.

## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing from experiments, observations, and simulations
- AI-driven generation and improvement of physical equations
- Equation verification through comparison with experimental results and other data sources
- Collaborative learning platform that encourages contributions from diverse scientific fields
- LaTeX integration for generating professional, accessible documents
- Robust testing and continuous integration
